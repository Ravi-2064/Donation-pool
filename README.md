# Donation-pool
#It is a web app which includes a web page located on a nonprofit's website where supporters have the opportunity to contribute funds to the organization's mission online rather than by mail or in person. Donation pages provide a convenient way to contribute, not requiring travel, envelopes, or stamps for supporters to give.
